* confident-mode

confident-mode is an experimental mode for Emacs that allows you to highlight different parts of a method depending of it's role.

The roles are defined in the book Confident Code (by Avdi Grimm)

* Usage

You need to require the mode at some piont in your init proces

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'confident-mode)
#+END_SRC

Then, on a Ruby file, launc confident mode (M-x confident-mode)

And that's it.

You can annotate any line, adding at the end any of the following comments, and the mode will highlight them:

- # INPUT   :: If the role of the line is "Collecting Input"
- # OUTPUT  :: If it's delivering output
- # WORK    :: If the line is efectively performing work
- # FAILURE :: If the line is handling failure

If you have the mode already loaded, you'll have 4 keybindings to set the annotations for you

- C-# i :: For appending # INPUT
- C-# o :: For appending # OUTPUT
- C-# w :: For appending # WORK
- C-# f :: For appending # FAILURE
